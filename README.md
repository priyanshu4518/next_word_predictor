## Introduction
The Next Word Predictor is designed to predict the next word in a given sentence. This project leverages advanced natural language processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning models to provide accurate predictions.

## Features
- Predicts the next word in a sentence.
- Utilizes NLP techniques and machine learning models.
- Easy to integrate with other applications.

## dataset 
the dataset is a basic english scripture captured from internet the aim to choose such a passage was that it contained a lot of words from the english dictionary and uses them in good sentences


## Model Architecture
The model consists of the following layers:
- **Embedding Layer**: Converts input sequences into dense vectors of fixed size.
- **LSTM Layer**: Captures the temporal dependencies in the data.
- **Dense Layer**: Outputs the probability distribution over the vocabulary
